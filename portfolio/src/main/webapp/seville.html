      <h2 class="sub-header">Trip Planning/Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Hotel: Gran Melia Colon - one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in: free buffet breakfast with so many delicious options (including lox, iberian ham, brie cheese, churros...),
            free flamenco dancing shows every Saturday evening, and truly unparalleled service and accomodations!</p></li>
        <li><p>Transportation: Everything within Seville is walking distance and just enjoying the leisurely strolls truly allows you to feel the delightful ambience of old Spanish
            architecture and blooming orange trees to their fullest.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h2 class="sub-header">Trip Diary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Day 1 - Seville</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a class="travel normal-bold-text" href="#map" onclick="flipInfo('Catedral de Sevilla')">Catedral de Sevilla</a>
            <p>Visited this magnificent cathedral with some truly stunning cieling designs, portrait rooms, and gold crowns.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>Would probably be a good idea to book tickets ahead of time as we didn't and had to wait about 30-45 min just to get in.</p></li>
              <li><p>Make sure to request a separate tour to visit the tower (La Giralda) as you can enjoy the best views of the city and the interesting
                  designs along the cathedral roofs.</p></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><a class="travel normal-bold-text" href="#map" onclick="flipInfo('Real Alcazar de Sevilla');">Real Alcazar de Sevilla</a>
            <p>This place reminds me of a summer palace (which it probably is) with some very unique architecture, beautiful ceilings,
                and a large, beautiful garden full of fountains and mini mazes. </p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>Also a good idea to book tickets ahead of time as we didn't and had to wait about 45 min to an hour just to get in.</p></li>
              <li><p>Keep an eye out for the peacock that casually roams around and poses!</p></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><a class="travel normal-bold-text" href="#map" onclick="flipInfo('Christopher Columbus Monument')">Christopher Columbus Monument</a>
            <p>Seemed quite close to the Real Alcazar, but due to the gates, it was actually quite a walk. Probably the least exciting landmark we visited
                but still cool!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><a class="travel normal-bold-text" href="#map" onclick="flipInfo('Plaza de Espana')">Plaza de Espana</a>
            <p> Beautiful plaza with horses, fountains, boats, and live flamenco dancers that create a relaxing and delightful environment. It's a truly magnificent area
                with many people milling around and beautiful architecture as befits a place to hold the World Expo.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><a class="travel normal-bold-text" href="#map" onclick="flipInfo('Universidad de Sevilla')">Universidad de Sevilla</a>
            <p> Walked through the university on our way back from Plaza de Espana to downtown Seville because why not?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><a class="travel normal-bold-text" href="#map" onclick="flipInfo('Amorino')">Amorino</a>
            <p> Wandered through the streets looking for a quick dinner and ended up having a very bad meal at Don Carlo, so of course, we
                decided to then fill ourselves up with ice cream and had some of the best ice cream ever at Amorino! Truly was so good that we came back the next day!
                Ordered the pistachio, vanilla, and coffee (3 scoops) with a vanilla macaron and it was the best thing ever! Also tried the black cherry sundae which was really good too.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li><p>Day 2 - Granada</p></li>
          <ul>
          <li><a class="travel normal-bold-text" href="#map" onclick="flipInfo('Granada')">Granada</a>
            <p>See my <a class="download" href="granada.html">Granada post</a> for details on how we visited Granada! Would definitely recommend making a half-day trip there while visiting Seville.</p>
          </li>
          <li><a class="travel normal-bold-text" href="#map" onclick="flipInfo('Catunambu')">Catunambu</a>
            <p>Enjoyed some churros dipped in hot chocolate for dinner (yes, I know but it's vacation) and then topped that off with more ice cream at Amorino nearby!
                To be honest, the churros weren't the best we'd ever tried but they were decent--would probably try a different place next time though.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><a class="travel normal-bold-text" href="#map" onclick="flipInfo('Gran Melia Colon')">Flamenco Dancing</a> 
            <p>Finished the day with some flamenco dancing at our hotel in Gran Melia Colon. Also ordered drinks and a fruit platter (that was actually quite large!)
                to go with it.
            </p>

        <li><p>Uno de Delicias - should have come here for dinner the first night, but didn't. Seems like a cute place with many great reviews!</p></li>

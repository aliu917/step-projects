      <h2 class="sub-header">Trip Planning/Notes</h2>
      <p>I'm sure Brisbane is an amazing and vibrant city to visit, but since our entire Australia trip was only a little more than a week,
          we weren't planning to make Brisbane a stop. However, we couldn't come all the way to Australia without hugging a koala, so we 
          squeezed this short 15-hour overnight layover in Brisbane just so we could visit the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Hotel: Capri by Fraser</p></li>
        <li><p>Transportation: We didn't rent a car as we were planning to rely on public transport buses, but since we were on such 
            a tight schedule, we ended up having to take a cab everywhere which ended up costing about the same as just renting a car for the day.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h2 class="sub-header">Trip Diary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Day 1 - Travel Half Day</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a class="travel normal-bold-text" href="#map" onclick="flipInfo('The Croft House')">The Croft House Town Kitchen</a>
            <p>Not many places were open as it was boxing day, but this nice sit-down establishment was quite crowded and their food was really good. 
                We were in sort of a hurry (and the service was quite slow) but it seemed like they had some buffet option with plenty of pastries and other popular options.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><a class="travel normal-bold-text" href="#map" onclick="flipInfo('Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary');">Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary</a>
            <p>This sanctuary has probably the best koala program (all the famous celebrities come here to meet and hold koalas) and 
                the staff were really kind to both koala and customers, giving us sufficient time to take a good photo and even taking extra group photos for us.
                They also have a lot of other cool animals and the kangaroo-feeding area was also super popular and cute!
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>Arrive right when the sanctuary opens (or within the first 30 min) and head straight to the koala simple-section
                  to get in line for koala holding if that's what you're here for. We came right at the 30 min mark and barely got into the first
                  koala holding section.</p></li>
              <li><p>Visit the kangaroos (and emus)! Feeding the kangaroos is really fun and you get some great pictures since both kangaroos and emus
                  are super friendly (especially when offered food).</p></li>
              <li><p>We had a flight around noon so we couldn't check out some of the other exhibits, but there are many other cool and unique animals that 
                  this can definitely be a day trip.</p></li>

      <ul>
        <li><p>Coffee Anthology - really wanted to try this breakfast place but they were closed on Boxing day.</p></li>
        <li><p>Gold Coast - if we had another day, visiting the gold coast beach and trying out hot air balloons seems pretty popular and cool!</p></li>

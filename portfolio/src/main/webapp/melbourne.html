      <h2 class="sub-header">Trip Planning/Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Hotel: Pullman Melbourne on Swanston - newly remodeled and very convenient location, although staying anywhere in CBD is 
            incredibly convenient and walking distance (or free tram distance) to all Melbourne city attractions</p></li>
        <li><p>Rent a car for one day to visit the Great Ocean Road</p></li>
        <li><p>Check out the free tram services <a class="download" href="files/melbourne-tram.png" target="_blank">here</a> (file from Public Transport Victoria)</p></li>

          <li><p style="font-weight:bold;">Hopetoun Tea Rooms</h2> <br />
            <p>Got off the plane, checked into our hotel (Pullman Melbourne on Swanston)
              and took a quick walk to The Block Arcade for an afternoon snack. Happened
              to stop by right when they were closing so we took some cakes to go. </p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>If you have the option, eat in since they give extra sides (like ice cream)</p></li>
              <li><p>Favorite: Apple Peach Blackberry Crumble</p></li>
              <li><p>Also tried: Bakewell tart, passionfruit tart (was half melted though since we 
                ate it the next day), Apple Cinammon Walnut Tea Cake, scones with jam</p></li>

          </li>
          <li><p style="font-weight:bold;">Dragon Hot Pot</h2> <br />
            <p>Spotted this popular hot pot restaurant near our hotel and enjoyed a large hearty meal. Buffet style entrance
              where you pick all raw ingredients you want (meats, vegetables, noodles, etc), pay by weight, and then they cook it up for you 
              and serve it back in one LARGE bowl.

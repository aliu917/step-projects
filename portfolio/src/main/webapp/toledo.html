      <h2 class="sub-header">Trip Planning/Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Transportation (Madrid to Toledo): Since this was just a day trip from Madrid, we took the ALSA bus from Madrid to Toledo which is a direct
            drive that took 1.5 hours one-way. Super convenient and the bus was pretty nice!</p></li>
        <li><p>Transportation (inside Toledo): Within Toledo, the town is small enough to walk. However, we did take the Toledo Train Vision (a small cute tourist train) for a 
            scenic overview of the city before we walked the small streets. Would definitely recommend as it takes you around the Tagus River for some unparalleled views, and would 
            definitely recommend booking ahead of time. (We tried taking the earliest offering at 9 am and were almost denied a spot but luckily they were able to add us on last minute 
            since we were only a party of 2).</p></li>
      </ul>

          <li><a class="travel normal-bold-text" href="#map" onclick="flipInfo('Train Vision station')">Train Vision </a>
            <p> Super cute train that takes you around the Tagus River and provides some historical commentary about the city. Would recommend doing this first to get a nice 
                background overview before hitting the streets.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><a class="travel normal-bold-text" href="#map" onclick="flipInfo('Catedral Primada')">Catedral Primada</a>
            <p> A grand and beautiful cathedral that I would definitely recommend visiting. Make sure to request an extra tour that goes up the tower as you get 
                some amazing views of the city and can even touch the large cracked bell at the top! In the summer, I can imagine this cathedral being a nice place to 
                cool down, but be warned, it's freezing in the winter time and we came on a very cold downcast day which made it feel even colder.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><a class="travel normal-bold-text" href="#map" onclick="flipInfo('Scenic alleyway')">Small streets of Toledo</a>
            <p> Had to record this cute spot I stumble upon as I got one of the best images of the charming small alleyways of Toledo with the cathedral tower 
                poking up in the background.
            </p>

          <li><a class="travel normal-bold-text" href="#map" onclick="flipInfo('Alcantara Bridge')">Alcantara Bridge</a>
            <p> A great place to walk along the Tagus river and get some great views of the river, Toledo, and the alcazar. </p></li>
          <li><a class="travel normal-bold-text" href="#map" onclick="flipInfo('Pasteleria Santo Tome')">Pasteleria Santo Tome</a>
            <p> Super cute, popular, and delicious mazapan spot. They sell a ton of varieties of mazapan pastries and it would be a shame to come out to Toledo without 
                trying some. You can even buy a some small goodie bags of mini mazapan treats to serve as great souvenir gifts! </p>
